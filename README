NAME
    Lingua::ES::Numeros - Translates numbers to spanish text

SYNOPSIS
       use Lingua::ES::Numeros

       $obj = new Lingua::ES::Numeros ('MAYUSCULAS' => 1)
       print $obj->Cardinal(124856), "\n";
       print $obj->Real(124856.531), "\n";

DESCRIPTION
    Lingua::ES::Numeros converts arbitrary numbers into human-oriented
    Spanish text.

    This module supports the translation of cardinal, ordinal and, real
    numbers, the module handles integer numbers up to vigintillions (that's
    1e120), since Perl does not handle such numbers natively, numbers are
    kept as text strings because processing does not justify using bigint.
